Back 2. Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of all integers positive for a given number x.

Back 3. Write a program that squares the given integer x until it is greater than 10,000 and gives its value. The Program is to print all the numbers and their results on the screen.

Back 4. Write a program that displays numbers x greater than the specified number y until the number 1000.
